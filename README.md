Mini Project 8: Bit trees and Braille

Members:
  Jayson Kunkel

About:
  This mini-project uses binary "bit trees" to convert between standard Braille, ASCII, and Unicode characters.


Resources:
  Labs and readings on binary trees:
    I referenced the binary search tree class when implementing BitTree, especially while writing the dump method.
  StackOverflow:
    I consulted StackOverflow while writing toBraille and toUnicode. 
  Java Character class:
    I also referenced the Character documentation while writing toBraille and toUnicode.
  Peers:
    Most of my project was completed in close proximity to my classmates, where we helped each other and shared ideas.
  SamR:
    SamR clarified some of my confusions over Teams chat.
